 **Telkom Internship Project: Assurance Consumer Web Application**

## **Overview**
This project is a web-based application developed during our internship at **PT Telkom Infrastruktur Indonesia TR1**, under the **MGR PERF, SERVICE QUALITY, HELPDESK OPS** unit. The application is designed to optimize data processing tasks in the Assurance Consumer division, focusing on managing ticket data from Excel files and improving operational efficiency.

The system supports two main user roles:  
1. **Admin**: Responsible for managing system configurations, including marking constants and monitoring data processing results.  
2. **User**: Responsible for uploading data, processing ticket files, and downloading processed results.
